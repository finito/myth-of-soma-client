Sprite - A single image. Contains pointer to texture, transform, and position.

MovementPath - A list containing tile positions entity will move to from current pixel postion.

Velocity - For advancing sprite position. A tile movement system would use this along side MoveList.

SpriteList - A component that has a list of sprites for use with entity that require multiple sprite to represent them.
Ordering could be important, unless the order in which the sprites be drawn is the order they have been inserted.
 - Could have a Equipment component with a SFML sprite pointer for each piece of equipment that is currently being worn.
   If the pointer is null then ignore it. But ordering would still be important. So a list of sprite might still be better given a way
   to specify the order and keep the list sorted by it.


World/Zone draw order

1. TIleMap
2. Shadow
3. Item
4. Everything else (Objects(Static sprite / animated sprite), Characters)


TileMap Solution 1
===============

TileMapRenderSystem

TileMapLoader
 - Load a tile map
 - Create entity with a component that contains the loaded tile map data.
 - Tag the entity as the tile map.
   - TileMapRenderSystem will use the tag.

TileMap Solution 2
===============

TileMapRenderSystem
 - Constructor takes a TileMap object
 - Use TileMap object to get tile data.
 - Use tile data to get tile set.
 - Use tile set to get sprite.
 - Draw the sprite.
 
TileMap
 - Functions to load and get tile data.


SpatialComponent
PositionComponent
AnimationComponent
EquipmentComponent
 - Replace with InventoryComponent
   - Then use item number to lookup the files to render what character looks like with equipment etc.
InventoryComponent
MagicInventoryComponent
AuraInventoryComponent
AbilityInventoryComponent
AttributeComponent
 - Health, Mana, Skin, Gender, Weapon Skill, Crafting Skill, Magic Skill...
   - Also put direction value here unless can find a better home for it.
   - Even though NPC do not need these will put them all in same place and themn can divide them up later if its worth it.

ChatComponent (Bubble chat that appears above characters head)
 - ChatMessage and timer

ArrowComponent
 - type
 - startPosition
 - endPosition
 - target
   - entity
 - hitOrMiss
   - bool, true for hit, false for miss
 - direction

BloodComponent

DirectionComponent (Can then move the direction variable from attributeComponent)
 - direction

DeathComponent
 - time
