TileMap blue area for safe zones.

Scaled down render of characters in party on left side.
 - Can create entity that duplicates the character data.
   - Then render the character spatial with a scale.
     - Has to render above everything though...so means adding a new layer to the render system and being able to
       render it at a specific point.

Sound and Music
 - Currently there is no sound or music playing at all.

Inventory Window
 - Physical and Magic attack / defense needs setting.

Coloured Guild Names
 - At GVW

Prevent the opening of GUI window if another that should block it is open.
 - e.g. Cannot open inventory and status window at same time.

Offset the Camera and Chat window when a GUI window is open on the left side.

Light changes due to night.

Closing of open GUI window when pressing escape.

Unloading of textures that are no longer being used.

   - Probably the easiest to implement.
 - Could wait until there is only a single refernece left.

Rendering of INV image files
 - (DONE) Shown at character selection and on inventory window.
 - Still need to add to Character Creation and Hair Shop when they are added.

Guild War eliminated name colour
 - Blacked out.

Hair colours
 - Currently not all of them are available and the client can show the wrong colour for hair.

Custom tooltip
 - So can use a static position and/or size.

Item Focus and Pickup needs improvement
 - The pickup needs moving out of the GUI.
   - Item can be picked up even if not focused if the mouse click did not attack a character etc.

Removal of WindowsLook scheme
 - Make it so that only soma.scheme is required.
   - Reduces GUI complexity.

Bug:Noticed that there can be entity that are invisible
 - Saw a bric on euro client that was not showing on new client and even attacking it did not show it.

Town Teleport effect.

Bug:Sometimes the character render at character selection is for the wrong character.

Bug:Noticed that character entity can still move fast sometimes (teleports to a destination).

Bug:Can see pk cursor when hover over player's character entity.

Low Priority
============
Character Focus
 - Remove the hardcoded width and height values for guild emblem.

MakeItem
 - When result is received it also sends a count and have to reset the item dura.
