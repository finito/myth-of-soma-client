RengerObject - > RenderEntities

Zone keep an entity list?

Add / Remove entity

Sorting entity by Y position

Sort when rendering or sort when Add
- Could be multiple add for a single render
  which would result in multiple sorts intead of single
  sort.

Where should entity list go?
  - Does it really matter that much if it just goes in zone?
    - Can move it elsewhere easily later.

Entity list needs to be updated each frame

Entities add themselves to the list?

Some entity will always draw behind others
such as Items on the map.

MapObject replace render function with Update?


MapEntities
 - Load
   - Group together the Shadow and Normal types
   - Create new entity for each object
     - Shadow + Normal
     - HouseIn + HouseOut
 - Update
   - Updates the main list which contains other entities

MapEntity
 - AnimatedSprite
   - Shadow
   - Normal
 - Render
   - Shadow
   - Normal
 - Update
   - Possibly
   - Neater way to call update on the animated sprite.
 - Alot of entity will share same AnimatedSprite
   Resource cache should take care of this.
