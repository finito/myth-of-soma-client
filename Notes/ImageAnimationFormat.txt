Will be using PNG for images.
	- Maximum sprite sheet size  will be 1024x1024
		- To support wide range of GPUs

Conversion will have to be done for all current images including the animation.

Image Info File (IIF)
 - Image amount
 - List of Images
	- 
 - Frame amount
 - List of Frames
	- XPos
	- YPos
	- Width
	- Height
	- XOffset
	- YOffset
 - Animation amount
 - List of Animation

ANI
 - Total Frames
 - List of Frames
	- Frame Size and Offsets within the connected image file.
		- Connected image file can be done via file name of the image.
 - Speed of animation
	- Frames per second
 - Multiple animations per image file?
	- Might not be needed because directions will be in separate image files.

Armature and Man SPL
 - Convert to PNG
 - Each direction of each animation state will be a separate sprite sheet
	- Some can fit onto a single sprite sheet (All directions)
 - Shadows (armature A6XXXX)
	- Contrast + 30
	- Add and Apply layer mask filled with black at 50% opacity

BMP Tiles OBM
 - Convert to PNG to the nearest power 2 keeping them in same order as the SPL frames.
 - Some of them do not fit on a 1024x1024 texture
	- Some how need to split up into multiple textures without modifying the TSD format
		- Could be multiple files once texture has no more room on 1024x1024 it will create another
			- The file which will hold the frame offsets will also have to include something to link
			  multiple textures together.
		- Could instead create textures based on the map itself blocks of 1024x1024 which make up
		  the resulting map.
			- This will take a longer time to develop
				- Maybe could be a optimization if the other method of splitting them up into
				  multiple textures does not work out well.
			- Starting from top left of map and using the map TSD and TMN files make a large image
			  of the map then split into 1024x1024 textures.
				- To draw the map we can then draw a portion of the 1024x1024 texture and instead of
				  having to use lots of textures to draw a portion of the map, it will instead only
				  require a few textures (could be standing at the edge of textures).
 
Map Object SPL
 - Convert each object as separate PNG to nearest power 2
	- This could end up being a problem that will take a while to solve in a good enough way
	- Will not work good for animated.
	- Map object format will need to be changed
		- Could do the conversion within code.
			- Replace the .ANI and .SPL with the new formats
			- Makes it more complicated than it has to be
		- Will need a converter from the current format to the new format.
	- Lots and lots of files
	- Some map objects are small and wouldn't make sense to split them up.
	
 - Shadows
	- Brightness - 127
	- Contrast + 56
	- Add and Apply layer mask filled with black at 50% opacity
