Tile Map (Looks Isometric)
 - Multiple layers
 - Change format?
	- This might be useful because could make it compatible with a better already existing editor.
Weather
- Rain

Resource Management

Technology used within current client
- MFC
- DirectDraw 7
- XAudio
- Intel JPEG Lib

New Client
Maxmium texture size
	- 1024x1024 - Should be the best to go with
		- Need to test on old laptop / old PC
Resolution Independence
	- Look into having virtual resolution to 720P 
		- Different width for aspect ratios
			- 960x720 4:3
			- 1152x720 16:10
			- 1280x720 16:9
		       - GUI needs it's native resolution changing depending on the aspect ratio
			keep it at 4:3 so things are not stretched but still positioned correctly.
Image format
	- PNG
	- Positioning of frames
	
Network
	- Has to be compatible with 1P1
		- Cannot use the SFML class sf::Packet
			- Uses big endian
		- Can use SFML TCP Socket
	- TCP

	

AnimatedSprite Class
- Inherit (Derive) from sf::Drawable
	- Don't want to use sf::Sprite because animated sprite could be more than a single image.
- Variables (Private)
	- Frames (e.g. std::vector<Frame*> _frames
		- Frame contains: Image reference, subRect and offset.
	- Timer to update the animation
		- Use sf::Clock
	- Speed how many frames per second
	- currentFrame
	- totalFrames - can get from _frames.size() instead
- Functions
	- addFrame (Image reference, subRect, offset)
		- Adding a frame will increase the frames that the animated sprite has got.
		e.g. If there is currently 10 frames and they are within a 1024x1024 texture. Then another
		image is added which has 20 frames within a 1024x1024 texture. This will then mean that the
		animated sprite has got 30 frames. Frame 1-10 will use the first image and frame 11-30 will 
		use the second image.
	- setSpeed
	- update
		- Advances through the frames of the animation and loops.
	
Character Class
 - AnimatedSprites vector
	- One for each state and the direction of it.
		- There are 8 directions
		- States include Stand, Walk, Run, Attack, and, Die.
