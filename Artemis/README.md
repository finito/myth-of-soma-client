Artemis C++
===

A C++ port of [Artemis Entity System Framework](http://gamadu.com/artemis/tutorial.html).

The port was orignially written by [Sidar Talei](https://bitbucket.org/stalei/artemiscpp/src), in which he used several C++11 features such as deleted function, variadic templates, nullptr, etcâ€¦
We wanted the framework to be portable, so we removed all C++11 feature usages.

### PORTED CLASSES

- Component
- ComponentMapper
- ComponentType
- ComponentTypeManager
- Entity
- EntityProcessingSystem
- EntitySystem
- SystemBitManager
- ImmutableBag
- EntityManager
- DelayedEntityProcessingSystem
- DelayedEntitySystem
- GroupManager
- IntervalEntityProcessingSystem
- IntervalEntitySystem
- Manager
- SystemManager
- TagManager
- utils
- World
- Bag

### EXAMPLE

`VelocityComponent` and `PositionComponent`.

``` cpp
class VelocityComponent : public artemis::Component {
public:
    float velocityX;
    float velocityY;

    MovementComponent(float velocityX, float velocityY)
    {
        this->velocityX = velocityX;
        this->velocityY = velocityY;
    };
};

class PositionComponent : public artemis::Component
{

public:
    float posX;
    float posY;
    PositionComponent(float posX, float posY)
    {
        this->posX = posX;
        this->posY = posY;
    };
};
```
	
MovementSystem updates positions base on velocities

``` cpp
class MovementSystem : public artemis::EntityProcessingSystem {
private:
    artemis::ComponentMapper<MovementComponent> velocityMapper;
    artemis::ComponentMapper<PositionComponent> positionMapper;

public:
    MovementSystem() {
        addComponentType<MovementComponent>();
        addComponentType<PositionComponent>();
    };

    virtual void initialize() {
        velocityMapper.init(*world);
        positionMapper.init(*world);
    };

    virtual void processEntity(artemis::Entity &e) {
        positionMapper.get(e)->posX += velocityMapper.get(e)->velocityX * world->getDelta();
        positionMapper.get(e)->posY += velocityMapper.get(e)->velocityY * world->getDelta();
    };

};
```
	
Usage:

``` cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {

    artemis::World world;
    artemis::SystemManager * sm = world.getSystemManager();
    MovementSystem * movementsys = (MovementSystem*)sm->setSystem(new MovementSystem());
    artemis::EntityManager * em = world.getEntityManager();

    sm->initializeAll();

    artemis::Entity & player = em->create();

    player.addComponent(new MovementComponent(2,4));
    player.addComponent(new PositionComponent(0,0));
    player.refresh();

    PositionComponent * comp = (PositionComponent*)player.getComponent<PositionComponent>();

    while(true){

        world.loopStart();
        world.setDelta(0.0016f);
        movementsys->process();

        std::cout << "X:"<< comp->posX << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Y:"<< comp->posY << std::endl;
        Sleep(160);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### LOGS

- Dec 10, 2012:
	- [Fixed  bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/449ee9d3167d6bdf8056a8da7554ebec016e5b65): calling Bag.get(index) not returning NULL when index > bag's size,
	which leads to memory violation when the number of entities becomes greater than initialized entities bag size.
- Nov 15, 2012:
	- [Fixed  bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/fe291598b699cd283fc029ee727669b8e7a76e24): memory leak when add a component to an entity
	who already had this component.
- Sept 11, 2012:
	- [Fixed critical bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/731d2c3e6f4afbd32e4d33f08f23373d62b91dd9): deleting World doesn't delete/reset all neccessary data,
which will lead to memory violation when a World is deleted and a new one is created.
- Sept 12, 2012:
	- Removed all C++11 feature usages.

# Myth of Soma Client
## Intro
A client for Myth of Soma that written in C++. Mostly an experiment to see if it was possible at the time to create a performant client that made use of OpenGL - *Spoiler: It was not performant at the time and ran really bad on Intel GPUs found within laptops and also uses more resources than the original client*.
The client does not use the original assets of the game (They have been converted using scripts written for https://www.gimp.org/ - can provide these separately when I've found and sorted them out) and instead uses assets that at the time were optimized for use with OpenGL. - Though it is probably worth switching to use the original assets instead or setting up a better pipeline for converting them. A link to the assets for the client will be provided separately - **Not yet uploaded**.

The client source code is provided as is and was written mostly between 2011-2013, it is incomplete and doesn't have all the features - mainly missing proper Magic and Aura effects.

Should compile using **VS2010** or **VS2015** it has not been compiled in any other version. Would be worth setting up **CMake** - https://cmake.org/ for this project.

## License Information:
The client code itself has been licensed under MIT though there are components of it that will have their own respective licenses. **Disclaimer**: I don't know how all these would work together so may need sorting out :)

## Uses:
* Boost libraries - Either get and use or replace with alternatives
	* smart pointers - These can be replaced by their equivalent C++ standard smart pointers
	* threading - The locks can be replaced by their equivalent C++ standard ones
	* boost format - Though I would recommend replacing and using https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt instead.
	* xml parsing - Could be replaced with something else instead
	* random - Again could be replaced
	* Other stuff that I've forgot to mention - Should be easily replacble
